# Image-to-cartoon-image-using-Pyhon
In this era of technology, cartoons do not need to be drawn manually. We have apps that can convert your images easily into cartoons. Here we will going to that using OpenCV and Numpy library.
Created cartoon effect on the image using a few lines of code.

So we have done this by following some steps:
1. Uploading an image
2. Creating an edge mask by defining lines and giving blur effect via OpenCV library.
3. Reducing the number of distinct colors &
4. Combining the edge mask with the reduced-color image for the desired output.
